# data-projects

Whilst looking at new opportunities recently, I realised that I have very little to offer in terms of evidence of my competencies. 

An employer willing to accept a candidate without establishing their credentials are **big** risk takers, or perhaps they're not painting a totally accurate picture of the company and the role.
Either way, the main purpose of this repository is to begin building my portfolio for any potential employers.

If you are reading this, please feel free to send me any questions you may have. Or to challenge me on anything. Any feedback will be much appreciated!
